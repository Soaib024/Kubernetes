# Kubernetes Fundamentals

### Exploring the problems that Kubernetes solves

* Ensuring high availability
* Handling release management and container deployments
* Autoscaling containers

### When and where is Kubernetes not the solution?

* Container-less architecture: If you do not use a container at all, Kubernetes won't be of any use to you.

* Monolithic architecture: While you can use Kubernetes to deploy containerized monoliths, Kubernetes shows all of its potential when it has to manage a high number of containers. A monolithic application, when containerized, often consists of a very small number of containers. Kubernetes won't have much to manage, and you'll find a better solution for your use case.

* A very small number of microservices or applications: Kubernetes stands out when it has to manage a large number of containers. If your app consists of two to three microservices, a simpler orchestrator might be a better fit.

* No cluster: Are you only running one machine and only one Docker installation? Kubernetes is good at managing a cluster of computers that executes a Docker daemon. If you do not plan to manage a real cluster, then Kubernetes is not for you.
